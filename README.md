# Miscellaneous Formulae

A collection of Homebrew formulae for stuff that isn't notable enough to be merged into `homebrew/core`, but is probably still useful to have on hand anyway. 

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install alfiepates/formulae/<formula>`

Or `brew tap alfiepates/formulae` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alfiepates/homebrew-formulae/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
